## Dictionary API integrated website

#### Hosted at https://onevocab.netlify.app/

### Overall Functionality

1. When the user submits a word in the input field and clicks "Search," the script makes an API request to fetch dictionary data.
2. The dictionary data is then displayed on the page, including the word, phonetic pronunciation, audio pronunciation, definitions, examples, and synonyms.
3. The searched word is highlighted within the text content of the page.
4. The user can clear the input field using the clear icon.

This code creates a basic dictionary lookup web app with a user-friendly interface.
